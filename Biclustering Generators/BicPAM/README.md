# BicPAM

BicPAM is implemented as part of the [BicPAMS software](https://web.ist.utl.pt/rmch/bicpams/) (GUI implementation). Both an Desktop GUI and a Java API are provided.

For the GUI implementation there is no need for any script.

## Observations

- For the GUI implementation there is no need for any script.
- For the Java API implementation, data must be in the tsf format

## Files

- **myBicPAM.java**: Considering the Java API, this files was made to work on the "src/bicpam/tests/bicpam" folder.
- **convert_output.py**: Converts the output from BicPAMS to a more familiar format
