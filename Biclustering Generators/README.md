# Biclustering Generators

This folder stores scripts to generate Biclusters from the data csvs. Each folder have instructions for each algorithm:

- FABIA, implemented in R 
- ISA, implemented in R 
- Bimax, implemented in R 
- XMotifs, implemented in R 
- Spectral, implemented in R 
- CCC, implemented in Java
- BicPAM, implemented in Java

Aditionally, it stores scripts for the Clustering methods, since they are interpreted as Biclustering methods in our study.

- K-Means, implemented in Python
- Spectral, implemented in Python
- Ward's Hierarchical Method, implemented in Python
