# CCC

CCC is implemented as part of the [BiGGEsTS software](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/c7g5f/software/biggests2/) (GUI implementation).

## Observations

- The csvs generated aren't compatible with BiGGEsTS. You need to add a symbol for the (0,0) position and substitute the "," in the file for ";"
